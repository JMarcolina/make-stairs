# make-switchback-stairs
## Overview
A Blender Python script to make switchback stairs based on user-selected parameters. For now, the script uses hardwired values for those parameters.
I hope to combine this script with another script that makes spiral stairs.
## Adjustment Handle
The completed staircase has an empty at the lowermost step. This empty is parented to all objects in the staircase, allowing the entire staircase to be moved, rotated, or scaled as a unit by moving, rotating, or scaling this empty.
